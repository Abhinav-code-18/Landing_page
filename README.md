# Landing_page
This project is a simple, clean, and responsive landing page designed to demonstrate modern frontend development practices. It includes a structured layout with a header, hero section, main content area, and footer, styled to maintain a consistent and user-friendly appearance across all devices.

The navigation bar adapts automatically for mobile screens by converting into a toggleable menu, ensuring easy access on smaller devices. The hero section provides a clear introductory message with a call-to-action button, while the overall layout uses flexible styling so the footer stays at the bottom of the page regardless of content length. This creates a balanced and professional visual flow.

The project also focuses on readability, minimal design, and smooth user experience using clean CSS and a lightweight JavaScript interaction for the mobile menu. It serves as a foundation for building a more complete website, making it easy to extend with additional sections such as services, products, or contact forms.
